# Order-Of-Growth
Test the order of growth of linear, quadratic, cubic functions 

To run and compile in Eclipse: Select the ProbOne.java file and execute by going to the
‘Run’ menu and choosing the ‘Run Configurations...’ option. From the window that opens up, select the tab titled ‘Arguments’. In the first box (headed as ‘Program Arguments: ‘) type in the command line input to run the program (either 1 to run as a linear function, 2 to run as a quadratic function, or 3 to run as a cubic function).


To run and compile in the terminal: cd to the directory where this .zip has been downloaded (for me, cd eclipse-workspace, cd
AlgHW1Final, cd src) and type javac ProbOne.java to compile. To run, after being compiled, enter the command java -cp .
ProbOne [command argument: either 1 2 or 3].
